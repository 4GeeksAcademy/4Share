# 4Share - Knowledge Exchange Platform

4Share is a web-based application designed to connect users based on their skills and learning interests. Users can search for others with specific skills they want to learn, and if there's a match with skills they can teach, they can exchange contact information to collaborate and learn from one another.

I developed this project entirely on my own as part of my final project, driven by a passion for web development and the vision of fostering meaningful connections through shared knowledge.

The project is hosted on Render, so it may take a moment to fully load: [4Share Website](https://sample-service-name-h9k0.onrender.com/)



## Features

- User Skill Matching: Search for users by the skills you're looking to learn.
- Mutual Interest Matching: The platform allows you to find users who want to learn the skills you can teach.
- Contact Exchange: Once both users accept a match, contact information (Email & Phone) is automatically exchanged for external communication.
- Interactive User Profiles: Each user has a profile showcasing their skills and an average rating based on reviews from other users.
## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript React, Bootstrap, Use of Parallax & SweetAlert2.
- Backend: Python for the API, models and some scripts I made.
- Database: PostgreSQL.
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), UUID & Bcrypt.
## How It Works

1.      Sign up or log in to the platform.
2.      Create your profile, listing the skills you have and the skills you're looking to learn.
3.      Search for other users by the skills you want to learn.
4.      If a mutual match is accepted, you'll receive the other user's contact details to connect and start sharing knowledge!
5.      You can also send reviews for users you have shared knowledge with.








## Starting the page

To start the page, run the following commands

```bash
  npm run start
```

```bash
  pipenv run start
```

"And don't forget to change your 3001 port to public"

## Future Improvements

- Implement real-time chat within the platform for quicker communication.
- Expand search functionality with more advanced filters and skill categories.
- Visual enhancements across all pages, utilizing tools like Photoshop for design improvements.
- Option to ignore users who send repeated requests.
- OAuth authentication for easier and more secure login.



## ðŸš€ About Me ðŸš€
I began my career as a 3D artist before transitioning into Full Stack web development. During my time in videogame creation, I learned about development with languages like C#, C++, and worked extensively with node/shader/VFX creation (which is quite similar to coding).

I eventually shifted to web development, as I found it both rewarding and less complex than I initially expected.
